CYBERG is the owner and developer of the social digital restaurant chain, KAJAHU. The joy of dining together remains the same, but the customer communication is via new technologies, order and pay set from mobile or touchscreen tables. Our development team continuously improves hardware and software components, analyses data and develops/tests innovative elements of the AnyUpp platform. KAJAHU is expanding around the globe through an asset light sales system. Its hybrid business model merges fast casual dining with the technology sector and redefines what a franchise restaurant chain means. KAJAHU currrently has one unit in Budapest.
